# Metric/Imperial Unit Conversion

This is a school project where I am using tools like Git Bash, VS Code, and applying basic front-end development skills to build a unit conversion tool. The project allows users to convert between:

- Length (Meter/Feet)
- Volume (Liters/Gallons)
- Mass (Kilograms/Pounds)
